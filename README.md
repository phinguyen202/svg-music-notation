# SVG Music Notation ♪♫..

Since we must have a specficication to follow and do complicated things in music world, we're doing a POC and try to implement MusicXML spec into this lib first. Now you can clone this repo and run `npm i` then `npm start` to figure out the sample.

Beside that, the Standard Music Font Layout (Bravura font is one of implementation) is used to have a very fit symbols for this lib.

The first version 0.1.0 is totally behind and hopefully we can do much more on this new approach.
